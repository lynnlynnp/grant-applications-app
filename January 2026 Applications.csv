359948,Joanne Evans,Dinnington Community Primary School,school street,Dinnington,Sheffield,S25 2RE,"We would use the morning to help us start a forest school provision that could be accessed at Lunchtimes and for an after school club. Our school is in the lowest 1% of areas in England for deprivation and has very limited, under developed outside areas. Improved wellbeing and emotional regulation
The Forest School provision will give children regular access to a calm, natural environment during lunchtimes and after school. For many pupils, especially those who find the playground overwhelming, this space will support emotional regulation, reduce anxiety, and improve overall wellbeing. Time outdoors has been shown to help children return to class and home calmer, happier, and more ready to learn.
Positive behaviour and social development
Through shared outdoor activities such as den building, nature crafts, and team challenges, children will develop cooperation, communication, and problem-solving skills. The Forest School setting encourages positive relationships between pupils and adults, helping to reduce behaviour incidents during unstructured times like lunch and after school.
Inclusive opportunities for all children
The project will provide an inclusive alternative to traditional playground activities, supporting children who may struggle with competitive sports, sensory overload, or social interaction. Forest School activities can be adapted to meet a wide range of needs, including SEND pupils, ensuring all children have equal access to enjoyable and meaningful play.
Increased confidence and independence
Forest School experiences allow children to take manageable risks, make choices, and develop independence in a safe environment. Over time, pupils build self-confidence, resilience, and a sense of achievement, which positively impacts their attitude towards learning and challenges both in and out of school.
Stronger connection to nature and the local environment
Regular outdoor sessions will help children develop a respect for nature and an understanding of sustainability. This connection encourages environmental responsibility and supports the schoolâ€™s wider curriculum aims around science, geography, and personal development.

359978,DAVID MCILWRAITH,Darvel Primary School,Campbell Street East,,Darvel,KA17 0BP,"Darvel Primary School â€“ Outdoor Learning & Environmental Education Project
On behalf of the Darvel Primary School community, we are delighted to share our exciting environmental and outdoor education initiative - an ambitious project that will transform our approach to outdoor learning and would benefit immensely from Twinkl funding.
As a school of 248 pupils, we have big plans to enhance our outdoor learning provision, a priority area within our School Development Plan. We know that regular and meaningful engagement with nature from an early age not only supports many areas of the curriculum and promotes physical and mental wellbeing, but also fosters a lifelong respect for the environment.
We already have a strong commitment to environmental and outdoor education at the school, offering pupils meaningful experiences that connect them with nature and the community. These nature-led experiences are invaluable for our pupils, families, and the wider community, but we know there is much more we can and want to do. Thatâ€™s why this funding would provide a massive boost to our plans.
Our Vision
We would like to transform an under-utilised grass area at the rear of the school into a dedicated outdoor learning hub, which would enrich environmental education for all our young people. If successful, we would use the funding to create:
- An outdoor classroom-style shelter to provide a dedicated space for lessons in a natural environment, accessible all-year-round, whatever the Scottish weather brings!
- Dedicated seating areas for outdoor lessons and calm spaces.
- A greenhouse to provide a year-round learning and growing environment.
- Plants, trees, and shrubs to provide shelter and improve biodiversity.
- Natural play structures (e.g. willow teepees) to create shaded areas for outdoor reading and small-group learning.
- Raised beds for growing produce.
- An outdoor cooking/kitchen station.
- Enhancements to our gardening equipment.
- STEM zones such as weather stations and composting areas.
- Educational and Community Impact
We believe this dedicate space would have a huge and very positive impact on our school community as outlined below:
- Hands-on plant care and maintenance â€“ pupils will plant and care for the flowers, plants, and shrubs.
- Growing our own produce â€“ the raised beds will allow pupils to grow fruit and vegetables, giving them hands-on experience with healthy, sustainable food choices. We would also hope to engage the wider community through initiatives such as donating to the local food bank and selling produce at local markets, providing children with practical insight into the food chain and the value of community contribution.
- Creating a haven for ecosystems and biodiversity - pupils will be given the opportunity to design and build features such as bug hotels, mini habitats, and bird boxes to attract pollinators, insects, and birds - encouraging biodiversity within our school grounds.
- Supporting our diverse community of young people â€“ the space will support all learners, including those with neurodiverse needs. By creating a calming, sensory-rich, nature-based setting, we aim to promote emotional regulation, build confidence, and encourage independence while supporting environmental education for all pupils.
- Community engagement - our school hosts a variety of community events throughout the year, and we would plan to use this new outdoor space during these events to give families and local residents the opportunity to see first-hand how we are promoting environmental learning and experiences.
- Curriculum links - by enhancing and developing our outdoor space in these ways, the school will be supporting key environmental and learning objectives across the curriculum, including: Â· Understanding wildlife habitats, local ecosystems, and biodiversity
Â· Exploring sustainability and ecological responsibility
Â· Promoting care for wildlife and raising environmental awareness
Â· Encouraging community engagement through shared activities and initiatives
Bringing Our Vision to Life
The outdoor shelter is a key element of the project and is estimated to cost Â£12,500 to Â£14,000. The remainder of the funding would be allocated across the other features detailed above. We have a dedicated outdoor learning group at the school, and through this team, we would ensure the project is completed within six months if we are fortunate enough to secure funding.
With your support, we would be able to create an inspiring outdoor learning environment that will benefit generations of learners.

The funding would allow pupils access to high-quality audio equipment and resources that are not otherwise available in school. This would transform talking from a classroom activity into a real-world skill, giving pupils a genuine audience and reason to speak clearly, confidently and thoughtfully.
Podcast Pals would be a weekly after-school club where pupils will:
Plan and rehearse short spoken pieces (stories, interviews, book reviews, jokes and factual segments)
Develop turn-taking, listening and questioning skills
Learn how to speak clearly, using appropriate volume, pace and expression
Record and listen back to their own voices to self-reflect and improve
Work collaboratively to produce short podcast episodes to share within school and with families
The club is inclusive and particularly beneficial for pupils who:
Lack confidence in speaking
Have speech, language or communication needs
Are less engaged by traditional sports or performance club
The Â£500 funding would be used to purchase:
Child-friendly podcast microphones and headsets â€“ Â£180
Portable audio recorder / basic podcasting kit â€“ Â£120
iPad microphone adapters and recording apps â€“ Â£50
Story prompts, discussion cards and vocabulary resources â€“ Â£70

Improved confidence and clarity in spoken language
Stronger listening, turn-taking and social communication skills

In our rural area, many children use our free afterschool clubs. During the summer I do netball, I used to do art in the winter months but another parent and staff have set up crafting club leaving me a gap to develop something new. We have a selection of games in school but this tends to form the 'wet playtime' bedraggled box. Pieces missing so connect 4 has been used for 'shove halfpenny', top trumps with corners turned because the popular shiny cards have been grapped and hidden (down someone's pants on one occasion) and penguin pile up where the penguins don't balance because they've been chewed! I think you get the picture. I would buy quality games and pick up a piece of storage furniture from the community marketplace. Children haven't had dedicated time to learn and play with any of the games, reading rules and develop related skills. In our club they will be given new boxed eqipment, they will learn about taking turns, follow rules and how to congratulate someone when they beat you. I often say 'of course you're not going to beat me, I'm an expert because I've been playing this game for 40 years, but I will give you some tips!' In a games club I want to run weeks with themes. Games of chance (dominoes) where it isn't skill so don't get upset when you are beaten, developing resilience to loose. Games of skill (connect 4, OK, draughts), games requiring a steady hand (penguins, chairs, balancing monkeys, tip waiter), games of visual speed (dobble peach/avocado smash), games of strategy (uno, monopoly deal) games requiring physical strength (twister) games of knowledge (maponimoes, junior trivia) and then there are games we play just for the hilarity and fun! Once children have respect for their cupboard of games, then at wet breaks members/play leaders could use some of the resources in the hall space, sharing their skills and encouraging others to play too. At the last ASC of each half term we can invite families in to play games. In the future we could expand our games provision (if we buy quality copies from car boot/charity shop) to build our stock we can have a games library/loan shelf too.

In addition, I would introduce incentives, such as stickers, certificates, or bookmarks, to reward students who complete reading challenges, write book reviews, or actively participate in group discussions.

A reading shed for a particularly quiet Year 5 girl who loves reading but seeks a peaceful retreat from the bustling playground.

Mud kitchens and dance spaces to encourage creativity and physical activity.

That means our students can dive into proper, high quality investigations into plant respiration and transpiration instead of just imagining what the experiment might look like.
Right now, our equipment is so limited that students practically need to book a viewing slot to see a practical in action. With new potometers, whole classes can run the required experiments independently with no more crowding, no more â€œpretend you saw that bubble move,â€ just real science happening in real time.
This upgrade would benefit around 1,500 students across both schools, giving them richer practical experiences, stronger engagement, and a far deeper understanding of key GCSE biology concepts.

As a grant-maintained school, resources are limited, and discretionary funding is scarce. Despite these challenges, our pupils have shown exceptional enthusiasm and commitment toward developing this club.

This club aims to provide a positive, inclusive space where pupils can develop confidence, resilience, and a sense of belonging through teamwork, physical activity, and creative expression.
However, to allow the club to operate safely and to a competitive standard, essential equipment is required. At present, the lack of funding prevents pupils from accessing the basic resources needed to progress and to represent the school in competitions.
The requested Â£500 will be used to purchase; Cheerleading pom-poms to support routines and performances, Cheerleading uniforms to enable pupils to participate in local and regional competitions and essential equipment to ensure safety, consistency, and professionalism. These resources will allow pupils to train effectively, build confidence, and proudly represent Malone Integrated College at events and competitions.
The Cheerleading Club offers pupils opportunities for physical activity and improved wellbeing, development of teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills and increased confidence and self-esteem and a sense of belonging and pride in their school.

It allows students of all skill levels to experiment with different materials and styles without pressure or grades. The club would also create a positive community where students feel included, inspired, and proud of their work, helping them develop lifelong creative skills.

The club will combine physical activity, nature-based learning and teamwork to support childrenâ€™s health, wellbeing and engagement beyond the classroom. With increasing evidence that children in the UK are spending less time outdoors and are not always meeting recommended daily activity levels, this project offers a positive and practical response by encouraging active outdoor participation in a safe and structured environment.
The aim of the Outdoor Learning Club is to increase the amount of time children spend outdoors while promoting physical fitness, confidence and social development. The club will encourage teamwork, communication and problem-solving through cooperative games and group challenges. It will also foster curiosity and creativity by allowing children to explore nature, observe seasonal changes and engage in outdoor learning activities that support both physical and emotional wellbeing.
Activities within the club will include outdoor fitness circuits, team games, movement-based challenges and nature exploration tasks. Children will take part in scavenger hunts, environmental discovery activities and creative outdoor projects such as nature art and trail-based learning. All activities will be inclusive and adaptable, ensuring that children of different abilities can participate fully and feel confident and supported.
The Â£500 grant will be used to purchase essential equipment and resources that will enable the club to run safely and effectively. Funding will support the purchase of outdoor fitness equipment such as agility tools as well as learning resources. As a result of this project, children will spend more time being physically active outdoors and will develop improved fitness, coordination and stamina. The club will also support childrenâ€™s social and emotional development by building confidence, encouraging teamwork and strengthening positive relationships. Increased engagement, improved wellbeing and a greater appreciation for the outdoor environment are expected outcomes for participating children.
The equipment purchased through this grant will be reusable and sustainable, allowing the Outdoor Learning Club to continue beyond the initial funding period. Resources will also be shared across other outdoor lessons and extracurricular activities, ensuring maximum impact and value for money. Staff involved in delivering the club will develop confidence and skills in leading outdoor learning, helping to embed the project within the schoolâ€™s wider provision.
In conclusion, this Â£500 grant will enable the successful launch of an Outdoor Learning Club that supports childrenâ€™s physical health, wellbeing and learning. At a time when opportunities for outdoor play are declining, this project offers a meaningful and lasting way to encourage children to be active, engaged and connected to the natural environment.",-,"Art & Crafts, Extra-Curricular, Classroom Essentials, Forest School/Nature, Outdoor Learning/Play, PE/Sports, Student Wellbeing",7,England

The first one in June will be attended by groups of pupils from our Trust schools. This event will give children the chance to explore inclusion, connectedness, character virtues, spirituality, and what it means to work together with purpose.
The funding will be used to strengthen and expand this event by covering essential costs:
Outdoor venue hire at ARK@Egwood, allowing children to collaborate, reflect, and engage in outdoor socialâ€‘action activities.
Materials and resources for handsâ€‘on activities linked to inclusion and connection, such as pebble naming, beadâ€‘making, altarâ€‘cloth printing, and reflective prayer lines.
Ingredients and cooking supplies to enable shared meal preparation (pizza and fruitâ€‘dipping), supporting teamwork, belonging, and collective endeavour.
Why We Are Applying
The Social Action Conference has a powerful impact on pupilsâ€™ sense of belonging, spirituality, and understanding of inclusion. With funding, we can:
Deliver a richer, betterâ€‘resourced experience for participating pupils this year.
Create highâ€‘quality â€œgiftsâ€ for pupils to return to school with, strengthening QET connectedness.
Build a strong foundation to expand the conference to include additional schools next year, enabling even more children to experience the transformative impact of collective socialâ€‘action learning.
The Difference It Will Make
This funding will allow us to turn a successful Trust event into a scalable, inclusive, and sustainable programme. It will help children experience meaningful collaboration, creativity, and spiritual reflectionâ€”returning to their schools ready to share their learning through collective worship and displays featuring the words and ideas they gather during the day.

Our aim is to create an engaging environment that fosters learning through play, particularly in an area of high deprivation where resources are limited. The addition of new equipment will significantly improve the quality of outdoor learning experiences for our children.
Background
Our early years setting is located in a community that faces socio-economic challenges, impacting the opportunities available to our children. Many families in our area experience financial hardship, which limits their access to enriching activities outside of school. By developing our outdoor space, we can provide a safe, stimulating environment that promotes physical activity, social interaction, and cognitive development.
Objectives
The primary objective of this grant application is to secure funding for new outdoor equipment that will enhance our early years outdoor area. We intend to:
Create a Fun and Engaging Learning Environment: The introduction of new equipment, such as a mud kitchen, sensory play areas, and interactive installations, will encourage children to explore and engage in physical play. This will not only make outdoor time enjoyable but will also support their overall development.
Promote Learning Through Play: Research has consistently shown that play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education. By providing diverse play opportunities, we can facilitate learning in key areas such as language development, problem-solving, and social skills. The new equipment will be designed to stimulate curiosity and creativity, allowing children to learn through hands-on experiences.
Support Physical Development: Active play is crucial for the physical development of young children. The proposed equipment will encourage movement, coordination, and balance, contributing to their gross motor skills. This is particularly important in our setting, where many children may not have access to outdoor play facilities at home.
Conclusion
The enhancement of our early years outdoor area through the acquisition of new equipment is vital for the development of our children, particularly in a community facing high levels of deprivation. By creating a fun, engaging, and educational outdoor space, we can provide our children with the opportunities they deserve to learn and grow. We respectfully request your support in funding this initiative, which will have a lasting impact on our childrenâ€™s educational journey and overall well-being.",Mud Kitchen,"Community/Family Support, EYFS/Free Play, Outdoor Learning/Play, SEND/Sensory",5,England

The impact on our school community
This funding would significantly enhance our lunchtime provision by supporting our Year 6 young leaders who play a vital role during our busy lunchtime periods. These pupils work tirelessly to engage children across the school in active play and games, with particular focus on our quieter, shyer pupils who benefit from having a mentor to help them feel included and engaged.
What we would purchase

A large parachute for team games – perfect for whole-group activities that promote teamwork, cooperation and physical activity for children of all abilities
Sports equipment for mini exercise classes – including items such as resistance bands, cones, and small equipment to help our young leaders run structured physical activities that promote health and wellbeing
Resources for our environment club – including litter pickers, gloves, bags and storage solutions to support pupils who want to care for our school grounds
Additional playground games equipment – to provide variety and choice for all children during lunchtimes

As a rural community, access to varied enrichment can be limited, and many families rely on local providers like us to offer safe, inspiring spaces where learners can connect, explore new interests and grow in confidence. This funding would allow me to expand our extracurricular provision meaningfully in 2026, opening the door to new clubs and creative projects that would otherwise be out of reach for many of the children I support.
One of my key aims is to launch a Creative Writing and Storytelling Club, designed for mixed ages and abilities. Many learners struggle with confidence in English, yet flourish when given opportunities to express themselves without the pressure of assessment. With Â£500, I would purchase highâ€‘quality notebooks, sensory writing tools, prompt cards, story dice and visual resources to spark imagination. I would also invest in a small library of diverse, engaging texts to inspire reluctant readers and broaden the horizons of more advanced learners. This club would nurture communication skills, creativity and emotional expression, all of which are essential for wellbeing as well as academic progress.
I would also establish a STEM Discovery Club, offering handsâ€‘on exploration for children who may not otherwise access practical science or engineering activities outside school. Funding would allow me to purchase simple robotics kits, circuitry sets, magnets, microscopes and problemâ€‘solving challenges suitable for a range of ages. These resources would support teamwork, curiosity and resilience, helping learners experience STEM as something exciting, accessible and achievable. Many of my students thrive when learning becomes tactile and collaborative, and this club would give them a space to experiment, question and build confidence in a supportive environment.
Finally, I would introduce a Calm Crafts and Mindful Making Club, supporting learners who experience anxiety, sensory needs or low selfâ€‘esteem. This would include materials such as watercolours, clay, weaving kits, origami paper and mindful colouring resources. These sessions would offer a gentle, structured space where children can relax, socialise and develop fineâ€‘motor skills while building emotional resilience. For many learners, this kind of calm, creative time is invaluable and often difficult to access elsewhere.
The impact of this funding would be felt widely across our community. These clubs would not only enrich academic learning but also strengthen wellbeing, belonging and confidence, especially for children who need that extra encouragement. As a small, local educational setting, Â£500 would allow me to create sustainable, highâ€‘quality enrichment opportunities that continue well beyond 2026.
This prize would help me offer the kind of joyful, inclusive and empowering extracurricular experiences that every child deserves, and I would be proud to share the positive outcomes with you.","Clay, Paper, Card, Notebook, Microscope, Magnet","Art & Crafts, Books/Library, Extra-Curricular, Career/Life Skills, Classroom Essentials, CPD/Training, PE/Sports, Science, SEND/Sensory, Student Wellbeing",10,England

â€¢ Construction engineering tasks using Kâ€™Nex, Lego Education, or Meccano
â€¢ Coding and digital design using beginner friendly software
â€¢ STEM problem solving challenges (bridge building, marble runs, tower construction)
â€¢ Circuit building and simple electronics
â€¢ Team engineering competitions
â€¢ Design and build projects encouraging creativity and resilience
These activities are designed to appeal to a wide range of interests and learning styles, ensuring the club is engaging and accessible for all pupils.
Resources Required Robotics & Coding (Â£250)

â€¢ Coding accessories and batteries
Construction & Engineering Kits (Â£150)
â€¢ Kâ€™Nex or Lego Education sets
â€¢ Meccano or similar metal construction kits
â€¢ Reusable materials for engineering challenges (card, dowels, connectors)
STEM Consumables & Equipment (Â£100)
â€¢ Simple circuit kits
â€¢ Craft materials for design challenges
â€¢ Storage boxes and organisational trays
â€¢ Printing and laminating for challenge cards and instructions
This combination of reusable and consumable resources ensures the club can run sustainably throughout the year.
Impact on Children
The Holley Park Discovery Lab will have a significant and lasting impact by:
â€¢ Increasing engagement and enthusiasm for STEM subjects
â€¢ Improving teamwork, communication, and leadership skills
â€¢ Developing resilience through trial and error learning
â€¢ Supporting pupils who may struggle academically to experience success
â€¢ Encouraging girls to participate confidently in STEM activities
â€¢ Broadening aspirations and exposing pupils to future STEM pathways
â€¢ Creating a fun, supportive environment where children can explore and innovate
The club will enrich the school community and provide meaningful opportunities for personal and academic growth.

A place for SEN children to come at playtimes to have space, what developed was a space for some girls from boy heavy classes with less extraverted personalities to sit and talk and have time together. A place to talk and laugh and escape from the difficulties they face in class where sometimes it gets disruptive. We do 'forgotten skills' weaving friendship bracelets by hand, crochet, dream catchers. I work in a rural primary school where we have limited funding so most equipment comes from my own pocket but I would love to develop more forgotten skills like, sewing and embroidery, even things like making our own yarn or basket weaving with willow or seagrass. These are just too expensive for me and school don't have the budget to help with these so I am limited at the minute. My club has grown from 6 children to 14 all girls. Many girls don't have chance to go to after school clubs because of other commitments they have like mosque. It has been lovely to get to know them and to know they come week after week and we share talents and help each other and I get to see who they really are. I have never enjoyed doing a club more in my 15 years of teaching and look forward to my Thursday lunchtime calm club. That money would be wonderful for us to pursue some more forgotten and traditional skills and pursue some more interesting ones. I would love to buy willow and seagrass and a sewing machine, embroidery hoops, knitting needles for every child, large yarn so we can weave blankets with our arms. This is just unavailable to me because of cost and how much my club has grown in numbers. 14 sets of knitting needles or 28 balls of large yarn is just too expensove for me as I only work part time. £500 would be amazing for my club we could discover so many more things. The girls haveva choice of skills we pursue. Sometimes schools like ours get forgotten for more urban primary schools with children with free school meals, we miss out on so much funding and our children also face difficulties and challenges. We never have the resources to be able to do them because of cost. We have children with high SEND who come to our school and many of these girls enjoy the undisturbed time to laugh and play and talk on our calm club Thursdays. I hope you will consider our plea!

Many schools are now beginning to recognise that playtime is 20% of a child's week and that it should be utilised in a creative, inspiring way that makes children look forward to coming to school. To be able to deliver OPAL effectively you need a whole host of resources, storage and equipment. One of the areas that OPAL defines is the use of wheeled objects for all children.

Both clubs would run across our splitâ€‘site school and provide rich, openâ€‘ended learning opportunities for all 464 pupils, including those with SEND who benefit from sensoryâ€‘rich, handsâ€‘on exploration.
Water Play and STEM Club
his club would give children structured opportunities to explore scientific ideas through practical, outdoor investigation. Water is a powerful STEM resource because it naturally invites experimentation, problemâ€‘solving and collaboration.
Children would be able to:
explore flow, gravity, pressure and volume
design and test water channels, dams and bridges
investigate floating, sinking, filtration and erosion
build water systems using pipes, guttering and connectors
take part in STEM challenges such as â€œslow the flowâ€ or â€œbuild the longest channelâ€
regulate through calming, sensory water play
This club supports science, engineering, teamwork, resilience and emotional regulation â€” all through joyful, openâ€‘ended play.
Construction Club
Construction Club would give children access to largeâ€‘scale, openâ€‘ended building materials that encourage creativity, engineering thinking and collaborative problemâ€‘solving.
Children would be able to:
build dens, bridges, obstacle courses and structures
experiment with balance, stability, weight and height
use crates, planks, tyres and loose parts to design and refine ideas
work in teams to solve construction challenges
develop resilience through trialâ€‘andâ€‘error building
This club is particularly powerful for children who learn best through movement, handsâ€‘on exploration and teamwork.
Supplies needed: Water Play & STEM Resources (Â£250)
Guttering and downpipes
Pipe connectors and flexible tubing
Funnels, jugs, scoops and measuring cylinders
Water wheels, pumps or siphons

361291,Shelley Perry,Glastry College,Glastry College,Victoria Road,Ballyhalbert,BT22 1DQ,"I believe I should win the Â£500 to support extra-curricular clubs at my school because it would allow me to establish a Floral Design Club that offers creative, educational, and holistic benefits to our students and wider school community.
The Floral Design Club would provide pupils with a unique opportunity to explore creativity beyond the traditional classroom. Using the funding, I would purchase essential floristry materials such as oasis, trays, floral wire, tapes, tools, and a variety of fresh and seasonal flowers. These resources are vital for teaching correct techniques and ensuring students can safely and confidently create professional-quality arrangements.
As a qualified florist as well as teacher, I bring specialist knowledge and real-world experience that would make this club both educational and inspiring. Students would not only learn practical floristry skills, but also gain insight into a potential career pathway within the creative industries. They would develop transferable skills such as patience, attention to detail, teamwork, and problem-solving, all while working with their hands in a calm and supportive environment.
The holistic benefits of floral design are particularly important. Working with flowers is proven to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and support mental wellbeing. The club would provide a peaceful space where students can unwind, focus mindfully, and express themselves creatively. This is especially valuable for pupils who may struggle with more academic clubs or who benefit from hands-on, sensory activities.
In addition, the Floral Design Club would give back to the school community. Studentsâ€™ arrangements could be used to decorate the school for parent evenings, open days, and special events such as Christmas concert nights. This would help foster pride in studentsâ€™ work, enhance the school environment, and create a welcoming atmosphere for families and visitors. Seasonal projects could also encourage sustainability and an appreciation for nature.
Winning this Â£500 would not only fund materials, but would help establish a lasting, inclusive club that supports wellbeing, creativity, and community spirit. The Floral Design Club would be a meaningful addition to our extra-curricular offering and a resource students could benefit from for years to come!",Flower,"Extra-Curricular, EAL, Eco/Sustainability, Forest School/Nature, Gardening/ Allotment, In-School Visitors/Activity, Music/Creative Arts, SEND/Sensory, Student Wellbeing",9,Northern Ireland

While the club is currently running, we are operating with limited resources. This funding would transform the club from a temporary activity into a sustainable, long-term pillar of our school community. The enhancement would happen in three specific ways:
1. Inclusivity and Wellbeing: We have observed that the garden is a sanctuary for our students, particularly those with lower academic attainment. Teachers have noted that quiet children become talkative and confident while digging and planting, skills they then transfer back to the classroom. This grant ensures we can keep this vital, non-classroom space open and accessible to all backgrounds and learning styles.
2. Real-World Science: We want to move beyond watching videos about biology. We want children to get their hands dirty learning about soil health, ecosystems, and biodiversity.
3. Community Connection: We aim to grow enough produce not just for the school canteen, but to share with families and community organisations, teaching children about sustainable food systems.
To achieve this, we need to repair our aging infrastructure. The Â£500 would act as a ""Garden Rescue"" fund. We need to purchase:
â€¢ Material to repair rotting raised beds, ensuring they are safe and usable.
â€¢ Child-sized tools (gloves, trowels, watering cans) so that every child can participate simultaneously without waiting for a turn.
â€¢ Compost and Soil to revitalise the beds for the new season.
â€¢ Seeds and Bulbs (vegetables for the canteen and hedgerow plants/flowers to boost biodiversity).

Equipment and resources will support with our overall delivery of PE lessons and in resourcing our Health Fortnight (April/May 2026). Financial support would allow us to employ coaches to assist with lunch time and after school clubs and enhance our current offer to ensure a wider number of children are targeted and supported to be active and participate in after school and lunch clubs. Our Active Schools team currently support one after school activity for our primary 4 and 5 children. Enhanced provision would be possible, with the money being awarded, to employ more coaches and extend our club offer to other stages across the school. This will support families in ensuring their children can attend a free after school club, providing many of our children with access to an active session that they otherwise may not attend (out of school). Any support would be greatly received and very much appreciated!
Clubs children are keen to implement include:

I am an ELSA and understand that being outside and engaging with nature helps with well being. I have been doing it most days since we started in September and all children across the school are able to do the activities if they wish. We are a small school so all ages take part together. An example of some of the activities we have done so far are: quizzes, planting bulbs, planting tree saplings, making fairy gardens and building caves for teddy bears to hibernate. We have a garden area which unfortunately has fallen into disuse. Over the coming weeks, I will be starting work on tidying up areas as I think it would be a wonderful opportunity to increase the activities that could be offered. As an ELSA, I work with several children on friendships and co-operative work and use these activities outside to enhance what I do in our sessions by encouraging working together without the children realising it. When I arrive in the morning, some of the children will ask me what is planned for the day. Children are joining in, working together in mixed ages, they are getting dirty and smiling while doing it. Some of the children that dip in and out, are those that find playtimes difficult and this is when they are more likely to have fallouts and upsets and giving them activities to focus on reduces this. They are also learning to care for the environment around them by taking part in experiments to monitor the number of worms during different seasons and feeding the birds. The bulbs we planted were picked to attract pollinators. I would like to be able to do some of the ELSA sessions outside in the garden but there is a lot of manual work that needs doing first. Unfortunately, we do not have the right tools needed to work in the garden which is why I am entering this competition.",-,"Extra-Curricular, Forest School/Nature, Gardening/ Allotment, SEND/Sensory",4,England

This project places human connection, observation, and self-expression at its heart, encouraging pupils to look closely, work thoughtfully, and celebrate individuality.
Throughout the unit, children will be introduced to a diverse range of artists, both from their local community and from the wider world. By exploring many artistic styles, backgrounds, and journeys, pupils will learn that creativity and excellence are not defined by where you come from, what you own, or who you are, but by curiosity, practice, and imagination.
The unit will culminate in a celebratory exhibition, where childrenâ€™s portraits will be displayed and shared with families and the wider community. This event is designed to build pride, confidence, and a sense of achievement, ensuring every child feels seen, valued, and celebrated for their work.
Grant funding would allow us to significantly enhance the quality and ambition of this project. As a school with a limited arts budget, our access to high-quality materials is constrained, and many of our pupils may never have the opportunity to work with professional-grade art supplies. This funding would enable us to provide richer materials, expand creative possibilities, and offer an experience that feels special, memorable, and empowering.

Benefits of a School Sensory Club
A sensory club supports the diverse needs of primary school children, not just those with identified Special Educational Needs (SEN), by offering an environment where they can self-regulate and develop key skills.
Emotional Regulation: It provides a calm space to reduce anxiety, manage stress, and calm down from an overwhelming classroom environment.
Improved Focus and Learning Readiness: By taking a break in a controlled environment, children can return to the classroom feeling more focused and ready to engage with academic tasks.
Skill Development: Hands-on activities build fine and gross motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and problem-solving abilities.
Social Interaction: In a less structured setting, children practice turn-taking, sharing, and communication with peers, fostering social skills and empathy.
Supplies Needed for a Sensory Club (Â£500 Budget)
A sensory club can be established on a budget using low-cost items and repurposed materials. A Â£500 budget could cover core equipment.
Calming and Comfort Items:
Bean bags and large cushions for comfortable seating.
Weighted blankets or large stuffed animals for deep pressure therapy.
Ear defenders or headphones with calming music to block out over-stimulating sounds.
Visual and Tactile Stimulation:
Fibre optic spray or bubble tubes (consider a lower-cost jellyfish or lava lamp alternative).
Projector to display colours and patterns on white walls.
Sensory bins filled with inexpensive materials like rice, sand, or chia seeds (which can be made from simple recipes).
Tactile boards using fabric scraps or different textured materials.
Movement and Activity:
Mini trampoline or balance board for vestibular input.
Therapy or gym ball for bouncing or rolling activities.
Extracurricular Activities and Clubs Set Up
With Â£500, the school could fund the initial supplies for several diverse clubs, ensuring all children have access to new experiences that build confidence, resilience, and social skills.
Creative & Expressive Arts Club: Focus on painting, drawing, modelling clay, and creative writing.
Supplies needed: Paints, brushes, various types of paper, charcoal, air-dry clay, glue, and a variety of craft materials.
Gardening & Nature Club: Utilise outdoor space to teach children about growing fruit and vegetables and caring for the environment.
Supplies needed: Planters, gardening tools, seeds, soil, watering cans, and perhaps a small composter.
Physical Activity & Games Club: Offer a variety of sports and activities to promote physical health and teamwork.
Supplies needed: A versatile sports kit including balls (football, netball), skipping ropes, bean bags, and team bands.
STEM/Discovery Club: Conduct fun experiments and building challenges.
Supplies needed: Basic science experiment kits (e.g., solar educational kits), construction sets like Lego, and ingredients for simple, safe experiments (e.g., slime ingredients).","Paint, Clay, Paper, Glue, Ingredient, Lego, Cushion, Rope, Seeds, Vegetable, Planter, Soil, Football, Netball, Bubble Tube, Weighted Blanket, Projector, Balance Board, Ear Defender, Calming Music, Sports Kit, trampoline, Sand, Skipping rope, Ball, Bean bag, Watering Can","Art & Crafts, Baking/Cooking, Extra-Curricular, Classroom Essentials, EYFS/Free Play, Forest School/Nature, Gardening/ Allotment, Large Playground Equip, Music/Creative Arts, Outdoor Learning/Play, PE/Sports, School Pet/Farm, Science, SEND/Sensory, Student Wellbeing, Uniform/Clothing",16,England

This opportunity would allow our deaf young students to try a new sport, be active outdoors, develop skills, gain qualifications and experience adventures on the water for 12 weeks during the summer term.
Based on previous experience with Sailability volunteers at our local sailing club, we know just how beneficial this extra-curricular activity is for our students - they experience an increase in confidence, resilience and self-esteem, as well as gain many practical skills alongside all the health, educational, social and physical benefits. Sailing can be transformational for deaf young people with additional needs. We know the sensation and freedom of being on the water ignites something really powerful in them. This experience really makes a difference. What our students achieve through this opportunity shows them they can achieve anything they set their minds to. It offers our students a unique and fulfilling experience, helping them build more independent lives full of possibilities.
In anticipation of this summer termâ€™s sailing sessions, our deaf students with additional needs excitedly practice the British Sign Language words linked to this activity. They also learn skills for independence, such as preparing for the different elements and wearing the right clothing. Some of our students who have completed the Sailability programme over the last four years continue with their love of sailing after leaving the Academy and progress with their RYA sailing qualifications.

A grant to build and run a forest school would provide transformative benefits for students, the wider community, and the environment. Forest schools create hands-on, experiential learning opportunities that cultivate curiosity, resilience, and problem-solving skills in ways that traditional classrooms often cannot. By engaging with nature daily, students develop stronger confidence, independence, and teamwork as they navigate real-world challenges such as building shelters, identifying plants, or caring for outdoor spaces. These experiences support not only academic growth but also social and emotional development, which is essential for student wellbeing. A dedicated forest school would also enrich the curriculum across subjects. Outdoor science lessons become more meaningful when students can observe ecosystems directly, while creative writing flourishes when learners draw inspiration from the natural world. Physical activity increases naturally, supporting health and helping students who struggle with focus in indoor settings. For children with diverse learning needs, forest schools offer an inclusive environment where multiple learning styles are recognised and valued. Beyond student impact, the project would strengthen community ties. Partnerships with local conservation groups, volunteers, and families can help maintain the space, creating a shared sense of community. The forest school can also serve as a hub for community workshops on sustainability, gardening, and environmental awareness. Finally, investing in a forest school aligns with long-term environmental goals.

? Board Games & Social Play Lunch Clubs
This club would focus on:
- Turn-taking and cooperation
- Building friendships in a low-pressure setting
- Developing problem-solving and communication skills
- Games would be chosen to suit different ages and abilities, allowing pupils to engage at their own pace.
? Arts, Crafts & Creative Lunch Club
This club would provide hands-on, calming creative activities, giving pupils:
- A chance to express themselves creatively
- A purposeful, mindful activity during lunchtime
- Opportunities to work independently or collaboratively
- Current pupil interests include jewellery making, which we would actively build into the club offer.
What supplies would you need?
Funding would be used to purchase a varied range of high-quality, reusable resources, ensuring activities can be rotated across the term rather than being â€œone-and-doneâ€.
Planned supplies include:
- Up-to-date board games suitable for group play
- Beads and jewellery-making materials
- Painting-by-numbers sets
- Diamond art kits
- LEGO sets
- Mechanical model and construction kits

The sandpit area further supports collaborative play, enabling children to build, explore, and share ideas. Together, we feel these areas encourage engagement, improve wellbeing, and help children develop important life skills such as turn-taking, sharing, and resilience.
By investing in storage and additional resources, this funding will help us improve the PTAâ€™s initial investment and ensure the spaces are practical, safe, and inspiring for daily use. The impact of a Â£500 donation would be felt immediately and long-term, enriching playtime provision and helping with creativity, teamwork, and positive engagement for all pupils, particularly our children with additional SEND needs.","Storage, Mud Kitchen, Uniform, Sandpit","Extra-Curricular, Career/Life Skills, Large Playground Equip, Outdoor Learning/Play, SEND/Sensory, Student Wellbeing, Uniform/Clothing",7,England

The club meets every Friday from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM during term time and is primarily run by volunteers, with support from parents and guardians who bring the children.
During our sessions, the children enjoy free play, craft activities, snacks, group activities, and an opportunity to visit the tuck shop for affordable pick-and-mix sweets. However, as time progresses, our toys and equipment require replacements and updating. Despite our best efforts, we face challenges due to limited funding.
Additionally, a significant percentage of our participants are neurodivergent, and I aspire to create a more sensory-friendly play environment.

The PTA regularly organises fundraising activities and applies for grants and funding, fully aware that ongoing budget cuts mean school staff are working longer hours and facing increasing challenges in making limited budgets stretch, particularly in a small village school in a financially deprived area.
The after-school activity club would greatly benefit from additional investment to help expand the range of activities it can offer.

Outdoor play and activities are a core tenet of our approach to learning within the school environment, for which we have received national accreditation (OPAL Double Platinum Status, 2025). But despite this passion for our outdoor space, the main playground has not been updated for over 20 years. The aim in re-configuring and installing new outdoor play equipment is to provide a more diverse and open-ended play experience for our students. Our plans include:
A new swinging boat as a central feature within our existing trim trail.
An additional climbing play area extending from the lower slope.
A varied assortment of climbing and sliding play equipment coming off the top bank.
A basket swing tucked away in the area next to the thrive outside area.
This is a really ambitious and important project for our school, and your support in making this a reality would be invaluable to the whole school and village community.

These activities are accessible, engaging and promote teamwork, physical activity and social connection, particularly for learners who may not typically engage in competitive sports. With the right equipment, we plan to establish additional lunchtime and after school clubs that encourage participation, build confidence and support positive wellbeing.
Winning this support would directly enhance Learners experiences, giving them more chances to connect, explore new interests and develop lifelong skills through meaningful extra-curricular engagement.

366726,Sharon Marable,Kents Hill Junior School,Kents Hill Road,,Benfleet,SS7 5PS,"At Kents Hill Junior School, we have asked our children which After School club they would really like to have and we have considered what activity will provide multiple learning opportunities.
With this in mind, we are seeking Â£500 of funding from Twinkl to establish a Cooking Club that will provide enriching, practical learning opportunities for pupils who may otherwise miss out. The club will run weekly and will focus on developing essential life skills such as basic cookery, nutrition awareness, budgeting, teamwork, and independence, while also supporting pupilsâ€™ confidence and wellbeing.
This provision will be primarily targeted at disadvantaged children, which is a significant focus within our school community. We are particularly keen to ensure the club is accessible to pupils who face additional barriers, including EAL learners and Young Carers, many of whom do not attract additional funding but require extra support and inclusive opportunities beyond the classroom. The Cooking Club will provide a welcoming and supportive space where these pupils can build relationships, develop practical skills, and feel a sense of belonging.
The funding will be used to purchase key equipment to safely run the club and ensure sustainability, including items such as:
* cooking utensils and mixing equipment
* chopping boards, knives and safety tools
* measuring jugs, scales, bowls and baking trays
* portable hobs / slow cookers / air fryer (where appropriate)
* storage containers and basic food preparation equipment
By providing the necessary equipment, we will be able to deliver high-quality sessions that are engaging, inclusive and hands-on, enabling children to take part regardless of their home circumstances. We also aim to help pupils make healthier choices, increase their confidence in preparing food, and encourage positive family engagement by allowing pupils to share skills and recipes at home.
This funding would make a meaningful impact by creating a sustainable club that supports pupil wellbeing, builds life skills, and helps to close the opportunity gap for our most vulnerable learners.
